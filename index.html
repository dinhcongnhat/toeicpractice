Subject: Parking area reassignment
Dear Colleagues:
I just want to remind everyone that crews will begin construction on the new Colton Medical Nutrition Center on June 18.
Effective June 15, parking areas F and G will be closed until August 20, when construction is expected to be completed. Staff currently assigned to park in areas F and G will be given temporary "guest" parking stickers and must park in the guest-parking garage. The Property Maintenance Office will place stickers in staff mailboxes by 4 P.M. today. The sticker should be displayed on the driver's side window of the vehicle.
A construction access road will be created by closing the entrance and exit roads to parking areas F and G. This will also block access to the security building and the pond. However, a temporary alternative entranceway to those locations will be created. To help eliminate excessive traffic, please visit those places only when absolutely necessary. Take note that the Information Center at the main entrance will remain open during construction.
Please e-mail me directly with any questions regarding parking stickers.
Sincerely,

Attachment: Voucher
Dear Ms. Torres:
Thank you for taking the time to complete a survey about your recent experience at Woodruff's. We appreciate that so many people took the time to provide us with feedback since it helps us to improve the quality of our service.
We were happy to learn that your overall experience shopping at Woodruff's was a positive one. However, we were sorry to see that you shared one area of dissatisfaction with a significant proportion of the customers who responded to the survey. I want you to know that we are taking the survey results seriously. We plan to improve this area with training soon.
As an apology for our failure to meet high standards in all areas, I have attached a voucher for 15% off a future purchase (good for one year) at any of our three Clarksville locations. We look forward to serving you in the future.
Sincerely,
Marietta Passante`, questions: [ { id: 181, question: "What type of business is Woodruff's?", options: { A: 'A computer software company', B: 'A clothing store', C: 'A mobile-phone service provider', D: 'A consulting firm' }, answer: 'B' }, { id: 182, question: "With what statement about Woodruff's would Ms. Torres most likely agree?", options: { A: 'It is located close to her home.', B: 'It has a large staff.', C: 'It is relatively inexpensive.', D: 'It is open later than other businesses.' }, answer: 'C' }, { id: 183, question: 'In the e-mail, the word "appreciate" in paragraph 1, line 2, is closest in meaning to', options: { A: 'increase', B: 'order', C: 'understand', D: 'value' }, answer: 'D' }, { id: 184, question: "What most likely is Woodruff's planning to do?", options: { A: 'Teach its employees to be more friendly and helpful to customers', B: 'Make the workplace cleaner and more organized', C: 'Open an additional location in Clarksville', D: 'Offer a discount voucher to all customers who complete a survey' }, answer: 'A' }, { id: 185, question: "What is suggested about the survey?", options: { A: 'It has been taken by many customers.', B: 'It was created by Ms. Passante.', C: 'It is accessible on the company Web site.', D: 'It has been in use for one year.' }, answer: 'A' }, ] },

Dear Mr. McGivern,
I received my October order, but there were some errors. I received 20 dinner plates instead of 40, and seven water goblets arrived with cracks in the glass. Have you switched shipping carriers recently?
I have been a loyal customer since you opened five years ago, and never before have I experienced problems with an order. Incidentally, you might like to know that I spoke this morning with Ed Salek, owner of nearby Salek's Café. He mentioned that his last delivery from you had some mistakes too.
How soon can you fix my order? I have three parties coming up next week, so I need these items quickly.
Sincerely,
Deshauna Jacques

Dear Ms. Jacques,
I was very sorry to learn about your order, and about Mr. Salek's as well; I will extend my apology to him today. You are a valued customer, and I am embarrassed that you received such a poor shipment. We are in the middle of moving to a new warehouse, and it has not gone as smoothly as I had hoped. Regardless, I want to make amends as soon as possible. I have put in an order to correct the mistakes, and I hope you will accept a 15 percent discount on your next shipment. Just use code 15D when placing your order.
Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to correct this.
Yours sincerely,
Pete McGivern`, questions: [ { id: 186, question: "Why was the first e-mail sent?", options: { A: 'To ask for customer feedback', B: 'To seek a solution to a problem', C: 'To request a refund on an item', D: 'To cancel an order for tableware' }, answer: 'B' }, { id: 187, question: "What item was received damaged?", options: { A: '14L', B: '17P', C: '18S', D: '21G' }, answer: 'D' }, { id: 188, question: 'In the second e-mail, the word "extend" in paragraph 1, line 1, is closest in meaning to', options: { A: 'offer', B: 'delay', C: 'continue', D: 'increase' }, answer: 'A' }, { id: 189, question: "What is NOT indicated about McGivern Wholesale?", options: { A: 'It does business with restaurants.', B: 'It is changing the location of a facility.', C: 'It has been operating for five years.', D: 'It is revising its price list.' }, answer: 'D' }, { id: 190, question: "What will McGivern Wholesale give to Ms. Jacques?", options: { A: 'A rebate on shipping charges', B: 'An extra package of table linens', C: 'A reduced price on her next order', D: 'An updated invoice' }, answer: 'C' }, ] },

Dear Mr. Nunez:
I'm writing concerning the job in my dining room that I'd like to contract you for. I'd like work to begin on April 10, but after looking at the estimate you sent me, I have a question about your calculation of the total cost. Specifically, does your estimate take into account any permits that would be needed for the job? A colleague told me that there is an ordinance that went into effect last month requiring building permits for any renovation project. I really liked the job you did installing carpeting and painting in my living room last year, and I would prefer to work with a company that I know. However, I am on a tight budget, so I need to consider the charge for the building permit in the overall cost of the project. Could you please get back to me at your earliest convenience?

In Brief—20 March
As reported earlier this year, Gold Kettle Grocery is opening an additional regional distribution centre in Cardiff. Construction was postponed for a time because of an unanticipated problem related to the ground conditions on the site. However, the problem has been resolved, and the 40,000-square-metre centre should be fully operational in June. The grand opening is planned for the fourth of June. The warehouse has a special area with state-of-the-art equipment to store foods that need to be kept frozen or cool. The site will also include loading bays and offices.
The distribution centre is expected to create more than 400 new jobs, according to Myles Simler, vice president of operations. Because of the size and scope of the project, a variety of jobs will be needed, from warehouse loaders and drivers to clerical positions.

Dear Myles:
Thanks for giving me a lift to the grand opening earlier this month. I do not believe I have ever seen such a well-planned event. We should send Ping Chen something to show him our appreciation for organising it.
Now that the centre in Cardiff has been open for a few weeks, I think we should consider hiring a company that forwards automatic notifications to employees' mobile phones. Such a service would allow us to get messages to them quickly and also prevent mistakes with shipments. I have a contact who has worked in customer service at Calls For You. I think it's a good company, but Raven Notifications also looks good, and their rates are lower. I have attached information about both companies to help you decide which one we might use. Let me know what you think.
Sincerely,
Raadhika Baral
